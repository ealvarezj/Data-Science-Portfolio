This project should make use of the new data cleaning techniques, that we learned previously like: `apply()`, `map()`, `melt()`, `concat()` etc..\n",

    "Luckily there is no missing information in the `SeparationType`, `ID` ,`Cease Date` and `DETE Start` columns. From the other side, the columns with the most missing values seem to be very specific. Therefore not all employees may belong here. E.g: \n",
    "The `Torres Strait` may contain probably information regarding if the employee comes or lives in the [Torres Strait Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islands) or if the employee ethnicity is [Aboriginal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians). Since there are a lot of NaN values we can assume that a small portion of the surveyed employees belong to this categories. Which at the same could be one of the reasons for ending the employment. The other columns are mostly booleas, and show if the employee had extra possibilities like for example `Opportunities for promotion` or had some `Workplace issue`s in the past."
